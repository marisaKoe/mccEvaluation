# mccEvaluation
Evaluation of the best method within one block


This program evaluates the best distance or character-based concept tree reconstruction method described in chapter 4 in Köllner (2021).

Please note: to run this program you need your own list of trees (bootstrap replicates or posterior samples) and add the appropriate information either to the input folder or add the appropriate code in the main.py file. The input folder contains samples used in Köllner (to appear).
